# Phoneme Audio Files

This directory contains isolated phoneme (sound) audio files used for phonemic awareness activities.

## What are Phonemes?

Phonemes are the individual sounds in words, NOT letter names. For example:
- The word "cat" has 3 phonemes: /k/ /a/ /t/
- The letter "S" makes the phoneme /s/ (NOT "ess")

## Required Files

The following phoneme audio files are needed for the pre-reading activities:

- `s.mp3` - /s/ sound (hissing sound, like a snake)
- `m.mp3` - /m/ sound (humming sound with lips closed)
- `f.mp3` - /f/ sound (air through teeth)
- `k.mp3` - /k/ sound (back of throat, sharp)
- `h.mp3` - /h/ sound (breathy sound)
- `b.mp3` - /b/ sound (lips pop)
- `d.mp3` - /d/ sound (tongue on roof of mouth)
- `l.mp3` - /l/ sound (tongue behind teeth)
- `t.mp3` - /t/ sound (tongue tap)
- `n.mp3` - /n/ sound (nasal sound)
- `r.mp3` - /r/ sound (growling sound)
- `g.mp3` - /g/ sound (back of throat)
- `ee.mp3` - /ee/ sound (long e)
- `sh.mp3` - /sh/ sound (shushing sound)

## Recording Guidelines

1. **Duration**: 0.5-1 second per sound
2. **NO letter names**: Say only the sound
3. **Clear and isolated**: Just the sound, no extra vowels
4. **Consistent volume**: All files should be similar volume
5. **No background noise**

### Continuous Sounds (can be held)
- s, m, f, l, n, r, ee, sh
- Record these for about 1 second, holding the sound

### Stop Sounds (quick bursts)
- k, h, b, d, t, g
- Record these as short, sharp sounds (0.3-0.5 seconds)

## How to Create

You can:
1. Record yourself making the sounds clearly
2. Use text-to-speech tools (carefully check pronunciation)
3. Hire a voice actor for professional quality
4. Use free phoneme libraries online (check licensing)

## Current Status

⚠️ **These files need to be created.** The app will not function properly without them.

See `AUDIO_REQUIREMENTS.md` in the project root for more details.
